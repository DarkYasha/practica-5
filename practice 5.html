			<h4>Script</h4>
			<p id="word">After watching the second<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_video_animation" target="blank"> Ova </a>of this serie, i knew that the script was being improvised on the progress. So it's not even worth going deeper into the subject. </p>

			<h4>Animation</h4>
			<p>Toei Animation never has been characterized by be a big animation studio, but the level of the animation on Digimon Tri is regular.

			At least no is <a href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Super"><i> Dragon Ball Super</i></a> but the 3D animation is very annoyed.</p>

			<h4>Characters</h4>
			<p>Maybe the worst part of Digimon Tri is the characters development, it's not only bad but even a recoil in the characters that we already knew. The next are the main protagonist of the anime.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Taichi Kamiya</li>
				<li>Yamato Ishida</li>
				<li>Sora Takenouchi</li>
				<li>Koichiro</li>
			</ul>
			<p style="text-align: center;">And of the rest it's not worth talking about.</p>

			<h4>Soundtrack</h4>
			<p>The  music is the only element that maintain a worth level of quality, but sometimes it's  a little anticlimatical because don't fit with the situation.</p>
